Agile:
1. 
As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to not feel intimidated by the software and feel like I could easily learn it. 

As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to understand and easily monitor the work being done by the new member of my team. 


2. 
User story: As an avid Github user trying GiggleGit for the first time, I want to feel like my experience is transferable and I am not starting from scratch. 

Tasks: Mimic Github’s site navigation layout

Tickets: Display top repositories and recent activity in a column on the left; change font to DejaVu Sans Mono


3. Does not specify what type of user, task stated instead of a goal, no reasoning provided. 



Formal requirements:
1. 
Goal: The study will provide useful information about how the average user interacts with SnickerSync.

Non-goal: Each participant’s performance and interaction with the program will be individually analyzed to extract all useful information possible.


2. 
Non-functional requirements:
1. The research participants will experience a 5 minute break for every 30 minutes of experiment time. 

2. The identities of the research participants will remain unknown both to the people conducting the experiment and in published findings. 


3. 
Functional requirements (of the study):
1. The study will investigate the average time it takes for a user to successfully “sync with a snicker.”
2. The study will measure emotional responses in the control groups and variants.
3. The user study data will be published and made available to all relevant stakeholders.
4. There will be no interference or guidance with the program given by the PMs running the study.
